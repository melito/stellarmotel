This isn't finished or polished, but it can work with a bit of cajoling.

This started as a sideproject.  A different approach to parsing streaming video files on mobile devices.

APIs became available in iOS9 that negated the need for this file based approach.

This project could still be useful on Linux and other platforms, but until I have an itch that needs scratching on those platforms, I will probably not be updating this.
